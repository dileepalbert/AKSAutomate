# Securely Manage APIs on Azure with AKS, APIM and Application Gateway

![AKS-Ref-Achitecture-v2.1](./Assets/AKS-Ref-Achitecture-v2.2.png)

## Introduction

Ingress Security of Micro-services running within *K8s cluster* or as a *PasS* or *Serverless Function* is a basic requirement for Cloud Native applications. While *PaaS* and *Serverless* have options in-built being more managed and controlled services from Azure; but securing containerised applications, need additional steps and effort.

We had discussed those steps in details in [endtoendSSL](./endtoendSSL.md). This document would focus on another important Integration component of Azure - *API Management service* - which provides *Authentication, RBAC, API Policies, Routing* and many more...

### What the Document does

- Deep Insights of how Authentication and Policies in APIM works
- Describe *SSL* options involved in end to end communication
- What *Configurations* are needed for each *SSL option* at the Ingress end of AKS cluster
- End to End example - *Access APIs securely through Application Gateway* to *Ingress of AKS cluster* and finally to the *APIs inside the cluster*
- Although entire discussion is around AKS cluster as backend but is absolutely similar for UnManaged clusters on Azure like [CAPZ](https://capz.sigs.k8s.io/)

### What the Document does NOT

- Deep-dive into *AKS* and its associated components
- Deep-dive into *Azure APIM Service*
- Introduction of *Firewall* into this architecture - *<u>this would be addressed in a separate article with deep insights of Azure Firewall and how that integrates with this architecture</u>*
- Deployment automation of APIM or any other associated components

### Pre-requisites, Assumptions

- Knowledge of Azure APIM - *L200+*
- Knowledge on Containers, K8s, AKS - *L200+*
- Knowledge on Application Gateway  - *L200+*
- Knowledge on Azure tools & services viz. *Azure CLI, KeyVault, VNET* etc. - L200+
- Knowledge of SSL/TLS technology - *L200+*

## Plan

- #### Overview of API Management components
  - ##### APIs

    - APIs defined behind APIM

    - Each API is a collection of Operations

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-apis.png)

  - ##### Custom Domains

    - Refer [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/configure-custom-domain)

    - Map existing DNS name to the endppints exposed by APIM

      - **Gateway**

        - Default is: *<apim-service-name>.azure-api.net*

        - Multiple Domains can be configured as Gateway endpoint

        - Clients can call same APIM instance through ay of these custom endpoints

          ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-1.png)

        

        - Corresponding SSL certificate for each Domain can be uploaded or referred through some KeyVault

          ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-2.png)

      - **Developer portal**

        - Default is: *<apim-service-name>.developer.azure-api.net*

        - Provides Management plane for exposed APIs

        - All Exposed APIs are listed here; along with their Subscription Keys, if opted for

        - 3rd Party vendors can use this Portal to get New APIs and Updates as well as option to Test the APIs

          ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-dev-portal.png)

        - Custom Domains can be configured as *Developer Portal* endpoint

        - Clients can use this custom endpoint to launch Developer Portal

          ![apim-custom-domain-3](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-3.png)

          

      - **Management**

        - Default is: *<apim-service-name>.management.azure-api.net*
        - APIM instance as well as User of API management instance (the APIM operators) can use this url to make APIM management REST API calls

      - Each of the above Custom domians should be added as a CNAME record in the DNS server mapped to the original *Default Urls*

  - ##### OAuth+OIDC

    - Refer [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad)

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/oauth-aad-hl.svg)

      [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols on the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols)

    - Native or Web Client should call AAD Graph API to acquire a *Bearer Token* with a certain expiry and pass this through Http Authorization Header to the API call

    - APIM acts like OAuth client and calls AAD Graph API to verify the *Bearer Token*

    - APIM acts as *Resource Owner* to Allow/Reject API access

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-oauth.png)

      

  - ##### Manage CA Certificates

    - Certificates from KeyVault can be refrred Or Upload separately

    - *Does NOT work for Self Hosted gateway*

    - This is used to support HTTPS back end; and if NO custom Domain is configured for APIM

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-ca.png)

  - ##### Mutual TLS

    - Certificates from KeyVault can be refrred Or Upload separately

    - This is used for Client certificate validation; i.e. wher mTLS is intended

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-mtls.png)

      

  - ##### Groups

    - Collection of API Users

    - Custom Groups can be created

    - Azure AD Groups can be integrated

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-groups-1.png)

      

  - ##### Products

    - Collection of APIs

    - RBAC can be applied at this level to manage a set of APIs with granular control

    - APIM Policies can be applied at this level

    - Detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this Article

      ![apim-products](./Assets/apim-products.png)

      

      - Add APIs to the *Product*

      ![apim-products](./Assets/apim-products-apis.png)

      

      - Defione *Access Control* to a set of APIs through *Products*

      ![apim-products](./Assets/apim-products-access.png)

  - ##### Custom Roles

    - [Refer Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-role-based-access-control)
    - Detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this Article

- #### Overview of SSL Handshake flow

  ![SSL-Overview](./Assets/SSL-Overview.png)

  â€‹					**<u>SSL Handshake</u>**

  

  - Communication can be between  - a *Client* process and a *Server* process Or a *Server* process and another *Server* process

  - Client always initiates the connection requesting a validation of the Server

  - Server responds with its *SSL Certificate*, which also contains the *Public* key. *Private* key is kept with the Server

  - *Client extracts the Public* key from the Certificate

  - Client then creates a *Master-Secret* known as *Pre-Master* key

  - Client *Encrypts* this newly created *Master-Secret* key

  - Client then sends this key back to Server

  - Server now *Decrypts* the *Master-Secret* key by using the *Private* key that it holds

  - Server Send a **<u>DONE</u>** acknowledgement message back to Client - ending the *SSL Handshake* process

  - The *Master-Secret* key is used as a *Symmetric* Key for all subsequent *Encryption/Decryption* - during communication on both directions i.e. *Client -> Server* OR *Server -> Client*


  

- #### Action Plan

  ![apim-short-view](./Assets/apim-short-view.png)

  - ##### Application Gateway

    - Create *Application Gateway* resource
  - Configure *Backend Pool*
    - Configure *Multi-site Listeners* - supporting multiple tenants
  - Configure *Http Settings*
    - Configure *Health Probes* for each Http Settings
  - Configure *Rules* mapping with Http Settings and Backend Pool
    
- ##### API Management
  
  - Create *API Management* instance
    - Configure Network for APIM to an **External VNET** (*public IP*) Or **Internal VNET** (*Private IP*)
  - Define *Custom Domains* as needed
    - Add *Backend APIs*
  - Confgure *Backend APIs* to point to *Ingress Private IP*
  
- ##### AKS Cluster
  
  - Assuming an AKS cluster is created - *Public* or *Private*
  
  - Assuming an *Ingress Controller* is already deployed within above AKS cluster. The example in this exercise used Nginx as *Ingress Controller*
  
  - Configure Ingress object for below 3 SSL options
  
    - **SSL Offload**
  
    - **Backend Protocol - Https**
  
    - **SSL Pass-through**
  
- ##### Private DNS Zone
  
  - Resolve Private IP addresses on Azure
  
  - Application Gateway Host headers mapped to multiple tenants are added as A Record Set
  
  - All tenants are mapped onto the **Nginx Ingress** controller **Private** IP e.g.
  
    - ***<u>tenant-A</u>.<private-dns-zone>.com*** **->** ***<private-ip-of-nginx-ingress>***
  
    - ***<u>tenant-B</u>.<private-dns-zone>.com*** **->** ***<private-ip-of-nginx-ingress>***
  
    - ***<u>tenant-C</u>.<private-dns-zone>.com*** **->** ***<private-ip-of-nginx-ingress>***

## Action

    - Ideally this should be done through ARM template; for this exercise we would assume that the resource would be created using Azure Portal

  - Configure *Network* for APIM

    ![apim-network](./Assets/apim-network.png)

    

    - A Private IP is assigned to APIM instance

      ![apim-network](./Assets/apim-overview.png)

  - Configure *Custom Domain* for APIM endpoints

    - **Gateway**

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-1.png)

      

      - Upload SSL certificates for *Custom Domain*

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-2.png)

      

    - **Developer Portal**

      ![apim-custom-domain-1](./Assets/apim-custom-domain-3.png)

      

  - Configure CA Certificates if mTLS is needed
